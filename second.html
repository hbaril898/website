    <h2 id="heading3"> Conservation</h2>
    In 2016, the panda's status was changed from "endangered" to "vulnerable" due to concerted efforts. This accomplishment demonstrates the effectiveness of conservation initiatives like the creation of protected areas and productive breeding initiatives. Panda populations have grown as a result of these initiatives, which have also shown how successful human intervention is at preserving animals.

    <h2 id="heading3">Threats for Other Species</h2>
    Many species are not as lucky as the panda. Multiple animals are in danger of going extinct as a result of illegal poaching and habitat damage, including tigers, orangutans, and rhinos. Climate change and pollution also pose a threat to marine life, including coral reefs and sea turtles. Every species has a distinct function in its environment, and its extinction has catastrophic repercussions.

    <h2 id="heading3">Habitat Conservation</h2>
    One of the best strategies to save endangered species is to preserve their natural habitats. Marine protected areas, animal reserves, and national parks offer secure habitats for species to flourish. By aiding in population reconstruction and biodiversity promotion, efforts to restore damaged habitats also help endangered species survive.
